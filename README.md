# jump-sorter
Automatic on the fly sorting tool.

jump-sorter is a python program that sorts out your data from a selected directory, directory of directories or a specific file.

Its still in its infancy, it can sort files and also it uses artificail intelligence to do advanced sorting suching as detecting and recognizing objects in images. it can also sort out pornographic materials using a nudity detection model.

More is still to come and please wait patiently while I fix the project so that anyone can use it.
