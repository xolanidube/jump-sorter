# jump-sorter
Automatic on the fly sorting tool.

jump-sorter is a pyhon progra that sorts out your data from a selected directory, directory of directories and a specific file.

Its still in its infancy, its can sort files and also i uses artificail intelligence to do advanced sorting suching as detecting and recognizing objects in images. it can also sort out pornographic materials using a nudity detection model.

More is still to come and please wait patiently while I fiz the projects so that anyone can use it.
